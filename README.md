# StochasticsLabPublic
This is the repository for the postgraduate course Stochastic Processes &amp; Optimization in Machine Learning. This course is included in the Data Science &amp; Machine Learning (DSML) program of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).  
  
Our 2021 course will include the following exercises provided as Jupyter Notebooks:  
1) Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression  
2) Logistic Regression, K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
3) Markov Chains and Simulation (heavily based on the Stochastic Processes course of the 6th semester in ECE NTUA)  
4) Simulated Annealing and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)  
5) Markov Decision Processes and Q-Learning  
6) Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Application in the BGP protocol)  
7) Naive Bayes Classifier (Application in DNS DDoS attack mitigation: the DNS Water Torture Attack use case)  
8) Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
9) Decision Trees and Random Forests  
10) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Application in the DNS DDoS attack mitigation: the DNS Water Torture Attack use case
