# StochasticsLabPublic
This is the repository for the postgraduate course Stochastic Processes &amp; Optimization in Machine Learning. This course is included in the Data Science &amp; Machine Learning (DSML) program of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).  
  
Our 2022 course will include the following exercises provided as Jupyter Notebooks:  
1) Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and Logistic Regression  
2) K-means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Self-Organized Maps (SOM) and Autoencoders  
3) Markov Chains and Simulation (heavily based on the Stochastic Processes course of the 6th semester in ECE NTUA)  
4) The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm  
5) Simulated Annealing  
6) Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks  
7) Markov Decision Processes and Q-Learning  
8) Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Application in the BGP protocol)  
9) Naive Bayes Classifier (Application in DNS DDoS attack mitigation: the DNS Water Torture Attack use case)  
10) Radial Basis Function (RBF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors  
11) Decision Trees and Random Forests  
12) Hopfield Networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Application in Network Security)  
  
Note: Some exercises are taken from online sources.
